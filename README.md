I am Laura Duarte, a PhD student working at the [Robotics and AI](https://github.com/Robotics-and-AI) research laboratory of the University of Coimbra.
My research is mainly focussed on the use of an event camera to enable Human-Robot Collaboration, using Deep Neural Networks to classify human actions.

## ✨ Highlights 

- **[DAVIS Data Capture System](https://github.com/Robotics-and-AI/DAVIS-data-capture-system)** 📷
  - Python code for recording DAVIS240C videos and processing event data into numpy format.

- **[Collaborative Tasks Benchmark (CT Benchmark)](https://github.com/Robotics-and-AI/collaborative-tasks-benchmark)** 🏙️
  - Collaborative Tasks Benchmark - 3D printable pieces for the study of collaborative assembly systems.
